Without prompt intervention, the decrease in blood flow to tissues results in ischemia. Frequent assessment of neurovascular function after fracture is essential. Sensory deficits, such as paresthesia (burning or tingling sensation), unrelenting pain, and numbness, are early signs of nerve involvement. Motor weakness may occur as a late sign of nerve ischemia, and a lack of movement suggests nerve damage. Pain is greater than expected and is not controlled by opioids. Prompt management of acute compartment syndrome is essential to avoid permanent nerve and muscle damage or even necrosis. The provider needs to be notified immediately if neurovascular compromise is suspected.",

	"from": "Airway and breathing are the most important initial concerns for this patient. An important goal of initial assessment is to recognize the severity of the asthma exacerbation and administer effective treatment. This patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor with automated blood pressure measurement; IV access and continuous pulse oximetry should be established. Humidified oxygen is administered either by non-rebreather mask or by nasal cannula to keep SpO2 above 92%. Commonly used quick-relief medications to treat severe asthma exacerbations include short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids.",

Acute hemolytic reaction, the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening type of reaction, occurs when the donor blood is incompatible with that of the recipient. Symptoms consist of fever, chills, low back pain, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and anxiety. Then hypotension, bronchospasm, and vascular collapse may be the result. Febrile nonhemolytic reactions are the most common type of reaction, and allergic reactions are also possible.  When complications occur, the nurse stops the transfusion immediately, assesses the patient, and notifies the provider and blood bank.",
	"to": 	"在输血或输入血液制品时的护理措施旨在防止输血并发症，如果有任何迹象要迅速做出识别，且要迅速开始测量以控制并发症的发生。急性溶血反应，是一种最危险且潜在的威胁生命的反应类型，发生于供血者与受血者的血液不相容的情况下。症状包括发烧、发冷、腰痛、恶心、胸闷、呼吸困难和焦虑。可能引起低血压、支气管痉挛、血管崩溃。发热非溶血性反应是最易发生的反应，且过敏反应也比较有可能。当发生并发症时，护士需要立即停止输血，评估患者并通知主治医生及血库。"

	"from": "Nursing management objectives for the patient in the postanesthesia care unit are to provide care until the patient has recovered from the effects of anesthesia, is oriented, has stable vital signs, and shows no evidence of complications.  Pain control is a critical component of postoperative care and often includes IV opioid analgesic medications to provide immediate but short-acting pain relief. The most common adverse effects of opioid analgesic agents are constipation, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and sedation. Respiratory depression is a less common but serious adverse effect. Prevention of clinically significant opioid-induced respiratory depression begins with administration of the lowest effective opioid dose, careful titration, and close nurse monitoring of sedation and respiratory status throughout therapy. If respiratory depression occurs, the nurse provides appropriate oxygenation and ventilation and calls for help.",
	"to": 	"护理措施的目的是为在麻醉恢复室中的患者提供护理，直到其从麻醉中恢复、调整、稳定正常的生命体征以及没有并发症的迹象。镇痛是术后护理的关键部分，通常包括使用静脉注射阿片类镇痛药物以达到立即且短暂的镇痛作用。阿片类镇痛药物的常见不良反应为便秘、恶心、呕吐、瘙痒和镇静。呼吸抑制是一种少见但严重的副作用。对于临床上显著的阿片类诱导呼吸抑制的预防，是通过控制最低有效剂量阿片类药物、仔细地点滴以及在整个治疗过程中护士对镇静和呼吸状况的密切监测来进行的。如果发生呼吸抑制，护士会提供恰当的供氧量以及换气频率并呼叫帮助。"

When performing CPR, push hard and fast, allow complete chest recoil, and minimize interruptions.  Reassess the rhythm and attempt defibrillation every 2 minutes, or after 5 cycles of 30:2 compressions to ventilations. Immediately after each shock, resume CPR, beginning with chest compressions.
